# Inoduction

This is a simple hangfire on console app. Its intent is to test some features
and use this as playground for many other things.

## My Walkthrough

For starting the first build:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

For running the app with a watcher:

```bash
dotnet watch -p ".\src\HangfireOnConsole\HangfireOnConsole.csproj" run
```
